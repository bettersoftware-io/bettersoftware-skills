## Coverage

`pnpm coverage` holds every file of every package to the bar: 95% of lines,
statements and functions, 85% of branches. It runs in `pnpm gate:full`. A file
is measured with its own package's tests only, so a file that only another
package's tests run reads 0%. The gate decides pass or fail; this section is
what it cannot decide.

### Closing a gap

1. Run `pnpm coverage:gaps`. It measures afresh and ranks the files with the
   most lines no test reaches, across all packages.
2. Start from the top. Read the file and say what is uncovered: a branch, an
   error path, a whole module. Take first the code whose failure nobody would
   notice, such as the choice of adapter in a composition root.
3. Write the test through the public interface: the port, the presenter, the
   page object. Do not export an internal function to reach a line, and do not
   write a test that runs a line and asserts nothing.
4. Prove the test can fail. Put the mutant a wrong implementation would contain
   (`<` for `>`, a dropped guard) in a JSON spec and run
   `pnpm mutation-check mutants.json`; the format is at the top of
   `tools/coverage/mutation-check.mts`. `SURVIVED` means the test cannot see
   that mistake: strengthen the test. `NO TESTS` means the row's command ran
   no test, usually a `-t` filter that matches no title (vitest cuts an
   `it.each` title at 40 characters): fix the command. Skip this only for a test that already
   failed in front of you before the code existed.
5. Run `pnpm coverage` again.

### When not to chase the number

- **A file no test can reach** (generated code, an entry point that starts the
  app when it is imported): list it under `exclude` in
  `tools/coverage.config.mts`, written from the project root, with the reason.
  Create that file if it is not there; `tools/coverage/lib/config.mts` shows
  its shape and belongs to the add-on, so do not edit it.
- **A line only a real browser or a real network reaches**: mark it
  `/* v8 ignore next -- <why no test can reach it> */`. The gate fails a
  comment without the reason.
- **Test code** (page objects, contract tests, `testing/` harnesses) and files
  with nothing to run (types, re-exports) are already left out. They need no
  test.
- A missing test is never a reason. Do not lower a threshold, exclude a file or
  ignore a line to turn the gate green. If the bar looks wrong for a file, say
  so and leave the gate red.

### Reading the published report

The report on GitHub Pages shows the commit that built it, not the newest one.
Its first line states that commit and the date, and `summary.json` beside it
holds the same. Compare the commit with the code you are reading before you
quote a number from it. For a decision, run `pnpm coverage:gaps`: it is never
stale.
